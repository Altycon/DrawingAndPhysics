!** Must install express server **!

        -$ npm start (npm run start)

Code repository for my javascript canvas 2d and 3d 
-only using the 2D renderer so far
-will be constantly refactoring code, as I have few conventions
-this will probably eventually be my repository for any code that I reuse all the Time
-for ease of use to work on android (Termux and QuickEdit)

Code learned from and influenced by:
    -The Coding Train: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain
    -Hungry Turtle Code: https://www.youtube.com/c/Hungryturtledev

Thoughts began with:
    -Julian Barbour: The End of Time / The Janus Point

Hope to eventually work more with surreal numbers.
